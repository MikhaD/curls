# wget

A repository of files and scripts I want to have available through curl. Use

`curl https://github.com/MikhaD/wget/raw/master/<filename>`

to download any of the files from with repository using wget


## Files

#### `install_firefox_dev.sh`
Installs the latest version of Firefox Developer Edition in /opt.

Usage: `sudo curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MikhaD/curls/main/scripts/install_firefox_dev.sh | bash`

#### `full_screen.sh`
A script to enable full screen when running Ubuntu in VirtualBox. I wrote this over 4 years ago. I don't know if it still works, or if it is still necessary.
